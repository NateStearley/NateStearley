Hi, I'm Nate
            
I'm a second year computer science and buisness management student at the University of Minnesota.
Some of my past projects include game simulations in Python, a maze generator and solver in Java,
and temperature reading and display software in C and x86-64 Assembly.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C, x86-64 Assembly, and Ocamel.
- ðŸ”­ My favorite comeputer science class I'm taking right now is Machine Architecture and Organization.
- ðŸ˜€ In my free time I like to work out, play spikeball, take photos, and watch Formula 1.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how a super nova can commit election fraud.
