Hello, 

I'm Nate. Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota graduating May 2024. I have a strong interest in algorithms, data structures, machine architecture, and operating systems, with a knack for exploring low-level computing. I've developed a range of projects, from a multithreaded HTTP server to a sophisticated drone simulation program in C++. I also have experience with data prediction and visualization models, having worked with over 15 years of Arctic ice level data to predict future changes. In addition to my technical skills, I'm minoring in Business Management, which has given me a solid foundation in principles of management, financial accounting, and entrepreneurship.


Due to plagarism guidelines I cannot release any code created for course projects on a public reposity. However, if you're viewing my GitHub as a recruiter and would like to see my private portfolio please send me an email at Natestearley@gmail.com.
