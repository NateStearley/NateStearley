Hi, I'm Nate
            
I'm a second year computer science and buisness management student at the University of Minnesota.
Some of my past projects include game simulations in Python, a maze generator and solver in Java,
and temperature reading and display software in C and x86-64 Assembly.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C, x86-64 Assembly, and Ocamel.
- 🔭 My favorite comeputer science class I'm taking right now is Machine Architecture and Organization.
- 😀 In my free time I like to work out, play spikeball, take photos, and watch Formula 1.
- 💬 Ask me about how a super nova can commit election fraud.



Due to plagarism guidelines I cannot release any code created for course projects on a public reposity. However, if you're viewing my GitHub as a recruiter and would like to see my private portfolio please send me an email at Natestearley@gmail.com.
