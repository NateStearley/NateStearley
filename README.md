Hi, I'm Nate
            
I'm a third year computer science and buisness management student at the University of Minnesota.
Some of my past projects include game simulations in Python, a maze generator and solver in Java,
and temperature reading and display software in C and x86-64 Assembly.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, JavaScript, and Ocamel.
- ðŸ”­ My favorite computer science class I'm taking right now is Machine Architecture and Organization.
- ðŸ˜€ In my free time I like to work out, play spikeball, hike, and try new food.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how a super nova can commit election fraud.



Due to plagarism guidelines I cannot release any code created for course projects on a public reposity. However, if you're viewing my GitHub as a recruiter and would like to see my private portfolio please send me an email at Natestearley@gmail.com.
